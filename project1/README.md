# Project 1 Description:

## Experimenting with permissioned blockchains using Hyperledger
----------------------------------------------------------------

This project consists of two phases:

## Phase 1:
--------------------------------------

- In this phase students will learn about various tools required to install and use hyperledger fabric.
- Hyperledger Fabric is an enterprise grade distributed ledger based on blockchain technology that uses smart contracts to enforce trust between parties.
- The first task in this project is to install all necessary tools related to hyperledger fabric and hyperledger composer on an AWS virtual machine and bringing up their first hyperledger network using the scripts provided.
- Further students will experiment with .yaml files to create a specified hyperledger fabric network configuration and explore ways in which the cryptographic material for the network can be generated.

**Technologies used:**

- [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Cryptogen tool](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/commands/cryptogen.html)


**Deliverables:**

- docker-compose.yaml file used to configure the specified hyperledger fabric network
- crypto-config.yaml file used to generate the cryptographic material for the hyperledger fabric network

**Submission Guidelines**

You need to submit the entire custom_network folder by uploading it to your work directory on vocareum. **AWS virtual machine contents will not be submitted for grading**. You should use **scp** to copy your work onto the vocareum machine inside the work directory and then submit it.

**Units:**

- Unit 1 

**Due Date:**

- 16th January 2019

## Phase 2:
--------------------------------------

- In this phase students will learn about various tools required to build a business application using hyperledger composer.
- Hyperledger Composer is a set of collaboration tools, built with JavaScript, for building blockchain business networks that make it simple and fast for business owners and developers to create smart contracts and blockchain applications to solve business problems.
- The students will build an application that tracks the transaction history and attribute changes associated with the life-cycle of an order propagating through a supply chain.
- Students will learn about building a model for a business application and also write transaction processor functions, permissions for various actors and transaction inside the supply chain network.

**Technologies used:**

- [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/)
- [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/introduction/introduction.html)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [Testing Frameworks: Mocha and Chai]()
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs) 


**Deliverables:**

- Entire folder named **supply-chain**

**Submission Guidelines**

You need to submit the entire supply-chain folder by uploading it to your work directory on vocareum. **AWS virtual machine contents will not be submitted for grading**. You should use **scp** to copy your work onto the vocareum machine inside the work directory and then submit it.

**Units:**

- Unit 2 and Unit 3

**Due Date:**

- 27th Jan 2019
