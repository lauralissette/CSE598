Creating a custom blockchain network 
----------------------------------------------------------

This phase requires students to run a cutom public blockchain netwrk


An overview of the network we want to build:

* 24 full nodes
* Every node is a docker container and responds to all RPC commands on dash client
* Every node is connected to minimum 4 nodes and maximum 6 nodes in the network
* All nodes should be able to create transactions in regtest mode and mine blocks.
