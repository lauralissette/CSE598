# Project 2 Phase 1 Description:

## Experimenting with public blockchains using dashpay
----------------------------------------------------------------
This project consists of two phases:

## Phase 1:
--------------------------------------

- In this phase, students will learn 


**Technologies used:**

- Bitcoin/dash
- Docker
- Git

**Deliverable:**

- A folder that contains single shell file that runs a decentralized blockchain network (One would need to submit a folder with all files, but everything should be automated using a single shell file named submit.sh)

- The folder name should be public\_network, which should contain submit.sh, a Dockerfile and the dash source code that you are using to buold the containers. You can clone the dash source too in your submit.sh

- In this phase students will learn about various pre-requisites to install and use a cryptocurrency. 

- The first task in this project is to install all necessary pre-requisites required for dash wallet to run. (These usally are the same for all cryptocurrencies forked from bitcoin).

- All work will be done on an AWS virtual machine and bringing up their own blockchain decentralized  network by writing their own scripts.

- Further students will be tested on the correctness of the nature of the blockchain network. 

- The details of the network are given in network.md and customNetwork.md file
