# Project 2 Description:

## Experimenting with public blockchains using dashpay
----------------------------------------------------------------
This project consists of two phases:

## Phase 1:
--------------------------------------

- In this phase, students will learn 


**Technologies used:**

- Bitcoin/dash
- Docker
- Git

** Deliverable:**

- A single shell file that runs a decentralized blockchain network (One would need to submit a folder with all files, but everything should be automated using a single shell file named submit.sh)

- In this phase students will learn about various pre-requisites to install and use a cryptocurrency. 

- The first task in this project is to install all necessary pre-requisites required for dash wallet to run. (These usally are the same for all cryptocurrencies forked from bitcoin).

- All work will be done on an AWS virtual machine and bringing up their own blockchain decentralized  network by writing their own scripts.

- Further students will be tested on the correctness of the nature of the blockchain network. 

## Phase 2:
--------------------------------------

- In this we want the students to delve into the data structure that is the blockchain.
- We will be dealing directly with the ledger in this phase.

- The students are required to build a blockchain parser, that parses the hexadecinal ledger that is stored with each node on the network.

- This will help the student understand what information does the ledger store and how it stores for efficient access.

**Technologies Used**

- blockchain ledger
- python (recommended)
- tools of your choice to understand hexadecimal files
- C++ understanding (in order to understand dash code)
- Doxygen ( in order to generate comments/ class hierarchy of bitcooin/dash code)

** Deliverable**

- A single python file that fetches data from the blockchain
